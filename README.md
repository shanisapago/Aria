# Aria
## Description
Aria is a smart calendar application that allows users to create, edit, and delete events with ease.<br>
The app synchronizes with Google Calendar and provides notifications before upcoming events.<br>
One of Aria's standout features is its virtual assistant, Aria, which helps users schedule meetings through SMS.<br>
By providing a few details about the event, Aria contacts the other person via text message and attempts to set up the meeting.<br>
It uses the OpenAI API to understand and respond naturally, and once a time is agreed upon, the event is automatically added to the calendar.<br>
If the scheduling fails, the user is notified with the result of the conversation.<br>
Aria also leverages a Q-learning machine learning algorithm to learn each user's preferred time slots.<br>
Based on past scheduling patterns, the app suggests optimal time ranges for future events, improving the experience over time.<br>
Additionally, users can invite friends to events directly from the app, making it easy to coordinate gatherings and meetings.<br>

## Sign-up screen
The app includes a registration screen where users can sign up by providing a username, full name, password, and phone number.<br>
Input validation is performed to ensure all fields are correctly and securely filled.<br>
